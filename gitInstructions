HOW TO MAKE BRANCHES AND PUSH THEM

git checkout -b new_branch_name: makes a new branch with name new_branch_name
git branch: lists branches
git checkout branch_to_switch_to

**when making new files on the branch, commit before switching branches or they will be floating untracked files that any branch can access

git push origin branch_name
     - creates that branch with those changes on GitHub
     - branch_name must already exist
     
then pull request your changes to master on GitHub


git pull origin master: to update local master with remote master

git branch -D branch_name: deletes local branch
